	Identifier checks:

	1) simple        → Legal. Poor style for a class (should be TitleCase) and
	                   won’t match file/class name Simple, so bad choice.
	2) SimpleProgram → Legal. Good, descriptive TitleCase name.
	3) 1 Simple      → Illegal. Starts with a digit and has a space.
	4) _Simple_      → Legal. Underscores allowed, but poor style for a class name.
	5) *Simple*      → Illegal. * is not allowed in identifiers.
	6) $123_45       → Legal. $ and _ allowed, but terrible, not descriptive, starts with $.
	7) Simple!       → Illegal. ! is not allowed in identifiers.
